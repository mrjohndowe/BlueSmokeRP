LONDON STUDIOS - BIKE HIRE REWRITTEN TEXTURES

- We've included the Photoshop documents for the menus relating to renting the bikes.
- This is so you can retexture the menu to your native language or colours of choice.
- Please DO NOT move the buttons - they are hardcoded and moving them in Photoshop will 
  not move their physical position
- To update the pricing for the bikes, this will also need to be done in the config.

Hope this helps, and hope you enjoy the updated resource!

All the best,
LS Development Team
