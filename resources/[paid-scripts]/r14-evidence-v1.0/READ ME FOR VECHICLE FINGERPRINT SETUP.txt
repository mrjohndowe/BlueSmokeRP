Out of the box, qb-core does not have an functions that allow automatic generation of 
fingerprint evidence based on the vehicle. If you wish to modify your vehicle keys/theft
resource to work with r14-evidence, please do so at your own risk! BACKUP EVERYTHING you 
intend to change so that you can revert to a working copy. Do not make changes to your 
resources if you do are not familiar with lua or scripting languages, I will not offer free
support to fix resources broken attempting to modify them.

If you choose to proceed, you can generate vehicle fingerprints by using the following events:

-------------------------------------------------------------------

To create a car fingerprint, you must trigger this server event with two arguments:

TriggerServerEvent('evidence:server:CreateCarFingerprint', plate, location)

The first is the vehicle plate, please make sure that you are using QBCore.Functions.GetPlate()
in order to send this information to the event and NOT a native. This function formats the plate 
text, and if you simply use a native, you will get an unformatted plate that does match what is
in your database. 

The second is the location of the fingerprint. This is displayed in the vehicle evidence menu. It
should be a string describing where the fingerprint is found by the officer.

------------------------- example code ------------------------

local ped = PlayerPedId()
local pos = GetEntityCoords(ped)
local vehicle = QBCore.Functions.GetClosestVehicle(pos)

TriggerServerEvent('evidence:server:CreateCarFingerprint', QBCore.Functions.GetPlate(vehicle), "Driver Door")

In this function, we get the closest vehicle to the player ped, and supply it's coords to the included
GetClosestVehicle function to get a vehicle entity handle. That handle is then supplied to GetPlate() and
we specify that it is on the driver side door.
