Out of the box, qb-core does not have an functions that allow automatic generation of 
lock tampering evidence based on the vehicle. If you wish to modify your vehicle keys/theft
resource to work with r14-evidence, please do so at your own risk! BACKUP EVERYTHING you 
intend to change so that you can revert to a working copy. Do not make changes to your 
resources if you do are not familiar with lua or scripting languages, I will not offer free
support to fix resources broken attempting to modify them.

If you choose to proceed, you can generate vehicle fingerprints by using the following events:

-------------------------------------------------------------------

To create a lock tampering, you must simply trigger this server event with the coords of the tampering.

TriggerServerEvent("evidence:server:CreateLockTampering", coords)

------------------------- example code ------------------------

local pos = GetEntityCoords(PlayerPedId())

TriggerServerEvent("evidence:server:CreateLockTampering", pos)
