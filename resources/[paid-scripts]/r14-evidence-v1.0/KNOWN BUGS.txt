Known Bugs:

- player vs player bullet impacts are extremely finicky, they will not always attach 
correctly, likely do to how onesync handles damage events between players, as I learn 
more about how damage occurs across netsync this will be refined as much as possible

- bullet impacts will often not generate when shooting from first person in a vehicle
due to natives used to calculate bullet impact returning the location the bullet passes
through the windshield

- bullet impacts will not attach to blown up vehicles or dead peds, this is because all
natives that can be used to return damage done to these entities do not work if the ped
is destroyed (and therefore not taking damage)

[ NOT OBSERVED SINCE FIX IMPLEMENTED ] - bullet wounds will occasionally appear on vehicles for some reason, I believe I have
implemented the fix for this, and have not seen it since, but if it occurs please report
it 

- bullet impacts will occasionally draw at vector3(0.0, 0.0, 0.0) while being accurately
distance checked, I do not know why, and will implement a fix when I find out why this is 
occuring
