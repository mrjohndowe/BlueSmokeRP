If you use qb-smallresources, and have not made changes to it, you should be able
to use the breathalyzer events in this script without issue. If you have a different
resource that manages alcohol and consumables, you should set the config variable to
false for this part of the resource. 

If you wish to modify your resource to work with r14-evidence, please do so at your own
risk. BACKUP EVERYTHING you change so that you can revert to a working resource if 
needed. Do not make changes to your resources if you do are not familiar with lua or
scripting language, I will not offer free support to fix resources broken attempting
to modify them.

If you choose to proceed, you have several options to enable the breathalyzer and BAC
functionality:

----------- setting BAC via client event --------------

You can increase a players BAC by triggering the following event, either from the
client side or the server side. You will need to add one of the following event triggers
to your code where the resource successfully determines you drank the alcohol. Look for
events that restore thirst, apply status effects, or increase the amount the person has 
drank. 

TriggerEvent('evidence:client:SetStatus', "alcohol", time, abv) [ FROM CLIENT SCRIPT ]

or 

TriggerClientEvent('evidence:client:SetStatus', source, "alcohol", time, abv) [ FROM SERVER SCRIPT ]

******* the abv variable is OPTIONAL, and by default will be set to 15 or 0.015 BAC. ********

--------- setting BAC via server event (RECOMMENDED) ------------------

You can increase and decrease a players BAC by triggering the server side events from
the client side. These events WILL NOT work if triggered from the server, as they will
not be able to find the player's source. By default, an alochol item use triggered by this
event will increase a players BAC by 15 or 0.015 BAC per drink, you can set a value 
anywhere between 1 and 1000. 

TriggerServerEvent('evidence:server:IncreaseBAC', abv, target)

TriggerServerEvent('evidence:server:DecreaseBAC', abv, target)
